# Long-horizon planning

Rules so a project with twenty milestones is planned as honestly as one with three: bounded detail ahead, bounded read cost at session start, and a fixed point in the process where the plan gets re-examined.

## 1. Rolling wave

At any time, the current milestone and the next one are `planned` or later: a measurable exit, features listed, the milestone file present. Everything beyond that is `sketch`: a goal in one or two sentences in the roadmap, no milestone file, no exit criteria required yet. The linter permits `TBD` inside `sketch` sections of the roadmap and nowhere else outside `<project>/docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`.

## 2. Phase exits

Each phase states what it must prove and how that is measured. The design doc's success-criteria section is organised by phase, not by "first prototype" or similarly vague milestones. Phase 1's criteria are numeric from bootstrap, since it is the phase being built immediately; later phases' criteria are sketched at bootstrap and sharpened when the phase becomes `active`.

## 3. Design docs by phase

Bootstrap writes the vision, the core data model, the architecture skeleton, and one example instance covering phase 1 only. Each later phase, when it becomes `active`, gets the per-area design docs it needs under `<project>/docs/design/<area>/` and a new example instance exercising the systems that phase adds. A design doc written before its phase is active is `draft` and says so in its header (`references/core/doc-kinds.md §3`).

## 4. Re-planning cadence

The Close step of a milestone's last feature includes a roadmap review (`references/core/lifecycle.md §5`, item 7), run in this order:

1. Check the milestone's exit criteria against the evidence collected.
2. Promote the next `sketch` milestone to `planned` with a real, measurable exit.
3. Re-order or split milestones if what was learned during the milestone demands it.
4. Record any reordering, with its reason, as an ADR.
5. Batch-accept any ADRs still `proposed` from the milestone just closed.

## 5. Milestone size

Three to ten features per milestone, exit demonstrable in a single session by someone who did not build it; larger is split, smaller is folded into a neighbour. The full rule and its ID consequences are in `references/core/layers.md §5` and `references/core/layers.md §2`.

## 6. Dependencies

A milestone or feature line may carry `depends on: M3, M4-02`, written on the milestone's header or the feature's line. Dependencies let the roadmap run parallel tracks: the roadmap shows each track as a sub-section under its phase rather than forcing a single sequence.

The linter enforces two things here: it fails (`E008`) if a `planned` or `in progress` item depends on something `sketch` or `dropped`, and it warns (`W002`) if a plan is `in progress` while a dependency's feature is still unticked.

## 7. Bounded read cost

`<project>/docs/CURRENT.md` is generated, not written by hand: the active phase, the in-progress milestone or milestones, each claimed feature with its plan path and last progress note, open blockers, and the most recent evidence. It stays under forty lines by construction — anything longer belongs in the plan it points to, not in `<project>/docs/CURRENT.md` itself.

Session start reads `<project>/AGENTS.md`, then `<project>/docs/CURRENT.md`, then the plan for the feature being resumed or claimed. The milestone file and the roadmap are read only when planning a new feature or reviewing the roadmap, not on every session. Done plans stay where they are but appear only in a collapsed section of the generated index, so the index stays short as the project grows.

## 8. Worked example

A twenty-milestone project, three phases: P1 is `M1`–`M6`, P2 is `M7`–`M13`, P3 is `M14`–`M20`.

**At bootstrap.** P1 is `active`; P2 and P3 are `sketch`. `M1` and `M2` are `planned` (the rolling wave's current and next); `M3` through `M20` are `sketch` — a goal sentence each in the roadmap, no milestone files yet.

**At M2 close.** `M1` and `M2` are `done`. Each milestone close promotes the next `sketch` milestone to `planned`, so by the time `M2` closes, `M3` (promoted when `M1` closed) is the current milestone and `M4` (promoted now) is next, both `planned`. `M5` through `M20` remain `sketch`. P1 is still `active`.

**At P1 close.** `M1` through `M6` are all `done`; the rolling wave has already carried the `planned` pair past the phase boundary, so `M7` and `M8` are `planned` from milestones promoted during `M5`'s and `M6`'s closes. P1's exit criteria are checked against evidence and P1 becomes `done`; P2 becomes `active`, which is the trigger for writing P2's per-area design docs and its new example instance (`§3`). `M9` through `M20` remain `sketch`.
